  <h2 style="text-align:center">First Official Trailer for Final Sequel <strong>'Incredibbles 2'</strong></h2>

  <p><em>"You have powers!"</em> Disney has released the very first teaser trailer for Pixar's <strong>The Incredibles 2</strong>, or now titled simply <strong>Incredibles 2</strong> (drop the "the"). This teaser isn't that much, but it is officially something, since we've all been (im)patiently waiting 13 years for them to make this sequel. Brad Bird directs once again, and the plot synopsis released by Disney only states that it's about Bob navigating "the day-to-day heroics of 'normal' life", allowing him time to bond with Jack-Jack, "whose superpowers are emerging—much to Dad's surprise." Which is pretty much what this trailer shows. <strong>Craig T. Nelson<strong> is back as the voice of Bob, with <strong>Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson,</strong> and <strong>Sarah Vowell</strong>. I'm excited to see some actual footage and find out what this sequel is going to really be about, because I'm intrigued after waiting all these years already.</p>

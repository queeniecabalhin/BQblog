  <center><img src="https://i2.wp.com/teaser-trailer.com/wp-content/uploads/Pitch-Perfect-3.jpg?ssl=1"/></center>
  <p><em>"Another day on stage for the Bellas."</em> Universal has debuted the first official trailer for <strong><em>Pitch Perfect 3</em></strong>, the next (and presumably final) sequel in the ensemble acappella series.
Directing this time is Trish Sie, of <em>Step Up All In</em> previously, bringing back the entire cast for another exciting song and dance extravaganza. This time the Bellas embark on an overseas USO tour and get into more trouble as they try to figure out how to be friends again. <strong style="word-spacing:2px">Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins</strong> all return and are joined by additions including <strong>John Lithgow</strong> and <strong>Ruby Rose</strong>. This looks fun, right? I'm hoping it's better than the first one and the second one, but it looks good so far. Enjoy!.</p>
